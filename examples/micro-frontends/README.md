# Tucu UI MFE (Micro Frontend)

A monorepo micro frontend architecture built with Nx, React, TypeScript, and Vite. This project contains multiple independent applications that can be developed, built, and deployed separately while sharing common libraries and components.

> **🚀 New to this project?** Start with the [Complete Integration Guide](./docs/INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md) for a comprehensive step-by-step guide, or check the [Quick Integration Guide](#-integrating-a-new-micro-frontend-with-eburgostucu-ui) below for a quick reference.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

This is an **Nx monorepo** organized as follows:

### Applications (`apps/`)

- **authentication** - User authentication flow application with login, sign-up, password reset, and phone verification
- **landing** - Landing page application
- **user-profile** - User profile management application
- **dashboard** - Dashboard application

### Libraries (`libs/`)

Shared libraries used across applications:

- **api** - API client and React Query integration utilities
- **auth-security** - Authentication and security components, including auth provider and store
- **shell** - Shell wrapper and layout components that integrate with `@e-burgos/tucu-ui`
- **utils** - Utility functions, route constants, and shared constants

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v20 or higher recommended)
- **pnpm** (v8 or higher) - Package manager
- **Git**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will install all dependencies for the entire monorepo, including all apps and libraries.

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Application Environment
VITE_APP_ENVIRONMENT=local

# Application Ports (internal ports for each app)
VITE_APP_AUTHENTICATION_PORT=4200
VITE_APP_LANDING_PORT=4201
VITE_APP_USER_PROFILE_PORT=4202
VITE_APP_DASHBOARD_PORT=4203

# Unified Dev Server Port (all apps accessible through this port)
VITE_DEV_SERVER_PORT=3000

# Application URLs (for unified dev server)
# All apps are accessible through the unified server at http://localhost:3000
VITE_APP_AUTHENTICATION_URL=http://localhost:3000/authentication
VITE_APP_LANDING_URL=http://localhost:3000/landing
VITE_APP_USER_PROFILE_URL=http://localhost:3000/user-profile
VITE_APP_DASHBOARD_URL=http://localhost:3000/dashboard

# API Configuration
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com/dev/api
VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL=

# API Configuration
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-url/api
VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL=https://your-ws-url/ws

# Support Email
VITE_APP_SUPPORT_EMAIL=your-email

# Google Analytics (optional)
VITE_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_TAG_ID=your-id
```

> **Note:** Check `env.local-example` in the root directory for a complete list of environment variables.

## 🛠️ Development

### Running Applications

#### Unified Development Server (Recommended)

Check [tools/dev-server/README.md](./tools/dev-server/README.md) for more details.

The recommended way to run all applications is using the unified development server, which runs all apps on the same domain (simulating production behavior):

```bash
pnpm dev:unified
```

This command:

1. Starts all apps on their internal ports (4200, 4201, 4202, 4203)
2. Starts a centralized proxy server on port 3000
3. Makes all apps accessible from a single domain:
   - `http://localhost:3000/` - Landing page with app cards and auto-redirect
   - `http://localhost:3000/authentication`
   - `http://localhost:3000/landing`
   - `http://localhost:3000/user-profile`
   - `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

**Features:**

- ✅ **All apps on same domain** - No CORS issues
- ✅ **Simulates production** - Production-like environment
- ✅ **API proxy** - Automatic API request proxying
- ✅ **No CORS configuration needed** - Backend doesn't need CORS setup

#### Run a Single Application

If you prefer to work with a single app, you can run it individually:

```bash
# Authentication app
pnpm authentication

# Landing app
pnpm landing

# User Profile app
pnpm user-profile

# Dashboard app
pnpm dashboard
```

Each app will be available on its configured port:

- Authentication: `http://localhost:4200`
- Landing: `http://localhost:4201`
- User Profile: `http://localhost:4202`
- Dashboard: `http://localhost:4203`

**Note:** When running apps individually, they will be on different ports, which may cause CORS issues with API requests. It's recommended to use the unified dev server (`pnpm dev:unified`) for a better development experience.

## 🎯 Integrating a New Micro Frontend

> **📖 For a complete, detailed guide with step-by-step instructions, examples, and troubleshooting, see the [Complete Integration Guide](./docs/INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md).**

Each micro frontend in this architecture:

- Uses `@e-burgos/tucu-ui`'s `ThemeProvider` through the `ShellWrapper` component
- **Automatically uses MFE mode** - `ShellWrapper` always sets `architecturalPatterns="mfe"`
- Implements its own routing configuration using `IAppRouteConfig[]`
- Can be developed, built, and deployed independently
- Shares common libraries and utilities
- Supports route protection via `isAuthenticated` and `loginUrl` props

**Quick Start:**

1. Create app structure
2. Configure Vite and routes
3. Wrap with `ShellWrapper`
4. Add environment variables

See the [Complete Integration Guide](./docs/INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions, code examples, and best practices.

- **Unified Orchestration** - Shared `ShellWrapper` component for all apps
- **Tucu-UI MFE Support** - Built-in MFE mode in `ThemeProvider`
- **Shared Component Library** - Reusable UI components across apps
- **Type-Safe Imports** - TypeScript path mappings for clean imports
- **Independent Deployment** - Each app can be built and deployed separately

## 🔧 Nx Commands

Since this is an Nx workspace, you can use Nx commands directly:

```bash
# Run any target for a project
nx <target> <project-name>

# Examples:
nx build authentication
nx test authentication
nx lint authentication
nx dev authentication

# Run multiple projects
nx run-many --target=build --all
nx run-many --target=test --projects=authentication,user-profile

# Show project details
nx show project authentication

# Generate code
nx generate @nx/react:component my-component --project=authentication
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

> **📖 For detailed troubleshooting guides, see:**
>
> - **[Integration Guide - Troubleshooting](./docs/INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md#troubleshooting)** - Issues specific to integrating new apps
> - **[Development Guide - Troubleshooting](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#troubleshooting)** - Development server and environment issues

### Common Issues

- **Port conflicts**: Update port in `.env.local` or stop the process using that port
- **CORS errors**: Use the unified dev server (`pnpm dev:unified`)
- **Build errors**: Clear Nx cache with `nx reset` and rebuild
- **Dependency issues**: Clean install with `rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml && pnpm install`
